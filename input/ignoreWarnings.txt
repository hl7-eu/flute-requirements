# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem
# (And include comments like this justifying why)
# See https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig/blob/master/input/ignoreWarnings.txt for examples

# Suppress ResearchStudy link errors because ResearchStudy resource is not a Canonical resource and is supposed to be
The link 'https://flute.com/ResearchStudy/RS-ResearchStudyFLUTE' for "https://flute.com/ResearchStudy/RS-ResearchStudyFLUTE" cannot be resolved
Hyperlink 'https://flute.com/ResearchStudy/RS-ResearchStudyFLUTE' at 'div/p/a' for 'https://flute.com/ResearchStudy/RS-ResearchStudyFLUTE' does not resolve

# No performer provided for Patient Observations testing resources
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# Use fictitious URLs
No definition could be found for URL value 'https://flute.com/EvidenceVariable'

# This extension is not used in any profile but HL7 Publisher rises this error anyway
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/structuredefinition-implements could not be found so is not allowed here
No definition could be found for URL value 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/structuredefinition-implements'

# Should have examples for all profiles
The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this profile

# Name conflict, the CQL code remains correct
An operand identifier reference is hiding another identifier of the same name.

# CQL expression - functionally correct in our implementation despite validator limitations
