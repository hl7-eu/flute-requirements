# 2.3 User Requirements Specification for security and privacy

This section aims to identify the requirements that can be derived from the threat models and attacks identified in FLUTE, and therefore form the security and privacy requirements of the users and stakeholders of FLUTE platform.

Similarly to the TRUMPET platform, for accessing the FLUTE platform nodes (either data hubs or researchers) should authenticate securely.  The individual users should use a secure login to obtain permissions which their affiliation/node can grant them. As nodes will communicate over the internet, there is a need for a secure communication channel between nodes so information is protected from external actors. All the devices used in the FLUTE platform must be secure and up to date with security patches so they are not vulnerable to malware or other attacks from malicious external users. The FLUTE platform should provide a logging system for the federated learning process so it can be audited as needed.

Regarding privacy requirements we have focused on the data that is going to be used in FLUTE and how it should be processed. Data should never leave data owner infrastructure in an accessible way (i.e., as in the TRUMPET project, encrypted data may leave the data owner as long as the data owner has control over decryption, e.g., by having a share of the decryption key or by having verified the TEE enclave the data is sent to), only fully privatized information (according to a privacy metric provided by the TRUMPET platform) can be shared. The aggregation of local models, gradients or values should not leak any information on the sensitive data. User privacy should be protected by the FLUTE platform so that it is not possible to recover user information with attacks such as data reconstruction, membership or property inference attacks. Data hubs should be able to provide or deny consent to use their data in the training of a model and the data used to train the model should be minimized to that necessary to train the models. Moreover, the FLUTE platform should be compliant with regulation.

| **[URS-1](Requirements-URS-1.html)** | Data should never leave data owner infrastructure | High | Privacy |
| **[URS-2](Requirements-URS-2.html)** | Central aggregation of models should not leak any information of the data used to train local models | High | Privacy |

| **[URS-4](Requirements-URS-4.html)** | Communication between system nodes should be encrypted | High | Security and Privacy |
