# 2.4 Software Requirements Specification for security and privacy

This sub-section contains system security and privacy requirements that will serve as input to D1.2 and provide a technical description of FLUTE components needed to achieve these requirements. These requirements separate the ones identified in the previous sub-section into functional and non-functional.
