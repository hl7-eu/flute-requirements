# 2.1 Methodology

We used the following methodology. First, we researched the threat model to be considered in FLUTE. The threat model builds on the TRUMPET one, and takes into account the differences between TRUMPET and FLUTE. Next, a section of User and Stakeholder requirements was considered that provides high-level requirements that can be understood by non-technical people. Requirements are provided both in textual and tabular format. To capture the requirements, we utilized the expertise of researchers in PETs. The following section breaks down the User Requirements into Functional and Non-Functional requirements. These requirements are the basis of the System Requirements Specification that will guide the FLUTE software developers in the design of FLUTE components and architecture. These requirements are also provided both in textual and tabular format. Following the capture of requirements a section “PETs and security and privacy requirements” is provided, which identifies which of the captured requirements can be tackled with the use of FLUTE PETs, and also maps which particular PET (SMPC, TEEs, or a combination of both) is relevant.
