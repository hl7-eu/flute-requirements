# 5.3 Cross-border prostate cancer pilot study Requirements

**Requirements for the AI models**
FLUTE should consider impacts on the use of developed AI models, in particular when designing, developing and using artificial intelligence, FLUTE should assess the impact of this artificial intelligence on human rights, particularly the right to the protection of personal data, as well as human dignity and other fundamental values. This assessment should be part of a broader data protection impact assessment and should take into account the requirements set by the [High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/expert-group-ai). Above requirements should be continuously evaluated and addressed throughout the AI system’s lifecycle. The project should observe the developments regarding draft AI Act and - where appropriate - align with the standards for AI development that are set therein. The requirements will be in more detail described in T6.1: Legal and ethical compliance of the FLUTE platform.

4. PSA (ng/ml with one decimal)
5. DRE (normal =0 vs. suspicious =1)
